Version 1.0

Once program is started, a maze will be generated using a recursive backtracking algorithm. 
Once the maze is generated, place the cheese somewhere in the maze, then place the mouse. 
The mouse will then proceed to travel the maze using a wall following algorithm until it 
finds the cheese. A new maze can be generated by selecting reset in the program's menu bar.

The source code offers an interface for easily adding more generation and solution algorithms 
to the program, to be selected from the drop-down menu.

Features such as running concurrent mice, placing multiple pieces of cheese and generating
mazes of varying dimensions are planned for future versions of the program.
