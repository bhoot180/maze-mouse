Version 1.0

Once program is started, a maze will be generated using a recursive backtracking algorithm. 
Once the maze is generated, place the cheese somewhere in the maze, then place the mouse. 
The mouse will then proceed to travel the maze using a wall following algorithm until it 
finds the cheese. A new maze can be generated by selecting reset in the program's menu bar.

The idea is to add alternative algorithms for maze generation and mouse behaviour in the 
future, and maybe even a feature to run concurrent mice and/or place several pieces of 
cheese.

It is possible to create mazes of any dimension, and this is also an extra feature to add to 
the user interface in the future.
